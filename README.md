# ESP8266 Ultrasonic Distance Web Server

This project uses an Arduino-compatible board and ESP8266 WiFi module to build a simple IoT system that measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and displays the data on a web-based dashboard.

## 📡 Overview

- The ultrasonic sensor detects the distance of nearby objects in real-time.
- Data is sent over WiFi using the ESP8266 module.
- A basic web server is hosted on the ESP8266 to show the distance in a browser.
- HTML and CSS were used to design a simple, responsive web interface.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Arduino IDE**
- **ESP8266 (NodeMCU or ESP-01)**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**
- **HTML / CSS for Web UI**
- **C/C++ programming for Arduino**

## 🧪 Features

- Real-time distance display
- Responsive web interface hosted on ESP8266
- Easy to connect with phone or PC via local WiFi
- Clean code structure with comments

## 🛠️ Hardware Required

- Arduino Uno / Nano / ESP8266 Dev Board
- ESP8266 WiFi Module (or NodeMCU)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- 5V Power Supply or USB cable
